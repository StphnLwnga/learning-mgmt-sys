# [Learning Management System Demo üîó](https://learning-mgmt-sys.vercel.app/)

## Setup

To run the project locally, install the project's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Rename the **`.env.sample`** file to **`.env`** and populate all the fields as described below. The variable names are self explanatory.

If you plan on running the app on another port or URL, change the value of **`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`** to the appropriate URL.

### Database

- The app has been tested with MySQL and PostgreSQL. The default database is currently set to MySQL.

- To use Postgres, change the provider in the **`datasource`** block in **`./prisma/schema.prisma`** file from **`mysql`** to **`postgresql`**:

  ```shell
  # ...
  datasource db {
    provider     = "postgresql"
  # ...
  ```

- Push the Prisma schema to the database

  ```sh
  npx prisma db push
  ```

  ```sh
  npx prisma generate
  ```

- Seed the database with categories:

  ```sh
  npm run seed
  ```

### Auth

- Register an account, and sign into **[clerk](https://clerk.com/)**, and create a new application.

- Name the application and select your desired authentication methods, and create the application.

- Select Next.js framework and copy the values of the API keys into **`.env`**.

- Set the values of the following variables as well:

  ```shell
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
  ```

### File Upload

- Uploads are handled using **[uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in)**. Sign in and create a new app.
- Name the app and Create App.
- Navigate to the API Keys section, and copy them into **`.env`**.

### Video Player

- **[Mux](https://www.mux.com/)** handles HLS playback.
- Sign up and select **Integrate with your app**.
- Select **Development** environment from the dropdown, and select **Mux Video**, and **Generate token**.
- Copy & Paste the **Access Token ID** & **Secret Key** to **`MUX_TOKEN_ID`** & **`MUX_TOKEN_SECRET`** variables respectively.
- Adding a credit/debit card to the free tier removes the watermark, 10 second limit, and video deletion after 24 hours.*

### Checkout

- Sign up for **[Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)**, verify your email, and navigate to your **[dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard)**.

- Follow **Step 1** of **Listen to Stripe events**.

- For **Step 2**, forward events to the webhook. If the app is running on <http://localhost:3000>:

  - Enter the following after **`stripe login`**:

    ```sh
    stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook
    # format:  stripe listen --forward-to <URL>/api/webhook
    ```

  - Copy the webhook signing secret to the **`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`** variable in **`.env`**

- If you decide to run the app on another port or URL, in the **Webhooks** tab:

  - Click **Add an endpoint**. Add the URL and description.
  - The webhook URL will be **`<URL>/api/webhook`**
  - **Select events to listen to** ‚û°Ô∏è **Checkout** ‚û°Ô∏è **checkout.session.completed**

## Run the app

```sh
npm run dev
```

The app runs on  <http://localhost:3000>.

To view database entries, while the app is running, run the following command in another shell:

```sh
npx prisma studio
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
